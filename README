Bragzz is the social "bragging" application allowing people to brag about different things is their lives and have social activities around their brags, such as other members of the bragzz community voting up or down (jealous/not jealous), comments forming conversations, etc.

This application is implemented using Grails web application framework.

Current status: the application is half finished, mainly needing UI work, so if anyone is interested in forking it and helping resurrect it, it could be finished and deployed on bragzz.com (already registered).
